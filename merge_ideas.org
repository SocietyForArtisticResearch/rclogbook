** Introduction :luc:

- Only one editor
- Editors are no longer to be selected for the entire expositions but
per page. 
- Each page of an exposition 

- how to select editor per page?
- transform one into another?

- tools have index

- text-based as reader/mobile mode, 1d order, can be viewed in two ways

- text format for expositions (json)


** Changes to the text-based editor :casper:
- 1d, form based (in elm)

** Media repo integration :casper:
*** Media Tab > Better fix icons for media upload and repo adding
*** Media Tab > Filters for Tags / Keywords / Type
*** Media Repo View > Mode where media repo replaces the weave editor, so user can create sets manage tags etc..
*** Technical > How could state be synced between media lists and repo's ? For example, when user is opening multiple tabs.
*** From set to exposition

** Changes and Adjustments :casper:
- Scrollbars on text tools. User controls width, height is left to content.
- Layers: editing part of an exposition where all other things are "locked". Currently tools can be locked
- Form / block editor / media list would still be visible. drag and drop.
- Table of contents / 
- Automatic adding of new pages (prompt user)
- upload dialogues 
- different types of import (material to be turned into objects)
    

** Question :luc:
- One type for both kinds of pages? (Just different ways of displaying)
- How to send events to/from elm elements (text-based editor and media
  repo) to/from graphical editor and media list?
- Possible function mapping over expositions (filtering, adjustments, ordering etc.).
- Possible real-time exposition editing.
