* RC Logbook

This file contains information on the current state of RC developments
and lists ideas, features, bugs and problems.

* Features and ideas
** Features in development

*** Archive expositions [ requisted ]

**** Ordering of portals by creation data / or alphabetic
*** Research Video Integration
** Features to be requested
*** TODO Picture tool should use tool defaut instead of intrensic size 
*** TODO Add "published by" to articles on the frontpage, published by JAR for example.
*** TODO Send email to NTNU admin when FEIDE student has logged in first time, creating a new account
*** TODO Media url's in text-based editor, not always translated to live url (https://www.researchcatalogue.net/text-editor/simple-media-resource?research=547070&simple-media=945677)
*** TODO Snapshot stored when admin changes revision state from "in revision" -> "in review"
*** TODO add trashcan button for comments on pages that can be seen by the commenter.

** Released features
*** Media Repository & API
*** add support for .art domains
*** Frontpage Redesign
*** SARA feed on front page
*** File size limit HTML import (raise to 10gb)
*** cms for about, terms and other static pages
*** feide login for ntnu bergen, nmh
*** terms of use simplification, checkbox online
*** css of profile page responsiveness
*** Make exposition version on submit 
*** Objects can now have a negative position but still be edited.
** Ideas
*** Reviewing menu
**** Order of items (add note should be first option)
**** Add-note keyboard shortcut
**** remove all notes action
*** Even stronger warning on self-publication. Inform user on DOI being created, and that this means that the reference is permanent.
*** Users to be member of only a portal and not of RC, so they cannot accidentily publish in RC portal.
*** view media set in exposition, also as replacement for slide show tool
*** dropbox mode (upload/add but not change) in media repo
*** Increase audio quality of zencoder (currently, uses pretty low bitrate, filters out everything above 15k)
*** Search through expositions
*** Undo button
*** Markdown in text/html tools
*** Text tools size warnings, current lack of limits stimulates risky designs.
*** Keywords: 
- Make keywords mandatory on publication
- Have a combination of closed and open vocabularies
*** versions visible for admins - for later reference/compare changes
*** exposition metadata export for journals
*** journal submission as application
*** application programs
save vs. submit, inform/warn people when deadline is close, message on save that this is not submitting
*** searchable inbox
*** object preview images without fixed width/height ratio. 
*** profile page
- better display of objects without image, "tumblr" page
- state share status clearly
- display abstract on/off setting
- show keywords
- tagging for profile organization / change group button for item
- collapse all groups
*** dates of expositions: 
- remove free "date" field. 
- add automatic creation date
- publication date will not be altered by unpublish/republished (only last modified)
*** editor role 
- can we allow this role without needing them to be portal admins
- list of objects of which they are editors
*** graphical editor
- pixel by pixel movement of tools with arrow keys (and pixel number display)
- linking to a tool instead of a position
- refresh overview when a tool was deleted
- alignment
- adjustments of margins for position links on the right side of the weave-some links currently 'bump' into borders, displaying the wrong position
- group selection (lasso / box selection)
- group locking (moving constallation)
- prototype tool/template
- copy-paste style tab settings
*** Archiving function
- this is an alternative form of publication where it is fixed, but only visible to portal admins. 
- probably needs some extra meta-data like department / context in which the archived exposition was produced.
*** Sortable list view of expositions on "Recent activity" "Recent publications", "My Profile" and other locations in RC.
*** elm text editor based on https://github.com/SidneyNemzer/elm-text-editor
*** comments/notes
**** footnote like comments {^1}
**** inline comments {<<>>}
**** {media} tag should be embedded in newlines for proper parsing of markdown paragraphs 
**** we need to rendered html version, one for public preview not displaying comments and one for editing (with comments)
*** footnotes
**** singled shared model for both editors
**** one list for the entire exposition
**** type of footnotes (references etc)
**** footnote edit page
**** reference counting, footnotes need to know where they are used
** Problems
*** Black bars in JWPlayer, which dynamically aplies "object-fit:contain" causing lots o problems. .jwplayer.jw-stretch-uniform video { object-fit: cover !important; } is a solution for now.XS
*** Line-height in HTML tool can cause issues (there is a tinymce css line that inherits it from parent, but this causes wrong size if there is styling inline the copied html). One solution could be to filter pasted html.
*** Unpublishing changes publication date when republished (for example 
*** Collaboration tab needs explanation text about what is what.         :UI:
*** Supervisor permissions behave weird on publication etc.
*** No quick way for supervisor to delete/manage all their notes.
*** Notes list
*** Private note
*** No duplicate names for expositions
*** Common user confusions:
- Adding a page, not showing up in Table of Contents
- Work / Exposition
- Video tool / Video embed
- PDF tool : Preview / PDF fields mixup
- Audio tool should not be an empty box, but communicate:
  "Audio tool: filename"
*** DONE Preview of text-based exposition does not update quickly enough
*** background color of text-based editor should not change when body background-color is set (connected to margin issue)
*** If a footnote reference is copied from one page to the next, the content of the footnote remains in the old page.

*** Background on WORK page is styled incorrectly: https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-work?work=410001

** Announcement Text
New RC Feature: Media Repository

We are happy to announce the upcoming release of a new RC feature. The
new media repository allows RC users to navigate, organize and manage
all of their media. Each user can browse and search the media that is
used in their expositions or collect media files and texts with which
to create an exposition later. The media repository facilitates
metadata editing, sharing, categorizing data, note taking, personal
and collective storage. It is the first use of the new media API,
which will enable the RC to be linked to external repositories as
well. The repository is fully responsive and will work on mobile
devices.
