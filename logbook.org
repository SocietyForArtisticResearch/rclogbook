* RC Logbook

This file contains information on the current state of RC developments
and lists ideas, features, bugs and problems.

** Features in Development
** Requested Features

** Ideas
*** Search through expositions
*** SARA feed on front page
*** Undo button
*** Markdown in text/html tools
*** Keywords: 
- Make keywords mandatory on publication
- Have a combination of closed and open vocabularies
*** Make exposition version on submit 
(also visible for admins) for later reference/compare changes
*** exposition metadata export for journals
*** journal submission as application
*** application programs
save vs. submit, inform/warn people when deadline is close, message on save that this is not submitting
*** searchable inbox
*** object preview images without fixed width/height ratio. 
- also objects even without image, "tumblr" page
- state share status clearly
- display abstract on/off setting
- show keywords
- tagging for profile organization / change group button for item
- collapse all groups
*** dates of expositions: 
- remove free "date" field. 
- add automatic creation date
- publication date will not be altered by unpublish/republished (only last modified)
*** editor view
- how to avoid them being portal admins
- list of objects of which they are editors
** Problems
*** Unpublishing changes publication date when republished (for example 
*** Collaboration tab needs explanation text about what is what.         :UI:
*** Supervisor permissions behave weird on publication etc.
*** Objects outside of visual field.
*** No quick way for supervisor to delete/manage all their notes.
*** Notes list
*** Private note
*** No duplicate names for expositions
*** Common user confusions:
- Adding a page, not showing up in Table of Contents
- Work / Exposition
- Video tool / Video embed
- PDF tool : Preview / PDF fields mixup

** Bugs
- Mail Link for owner with pseudonym on reviewing page
- Issue name is missing from research page. (also ordering is
  arbetrary, should either be customizable or make sense)
- date of last change not updated for text-based expositions
** Releases
*** <2019-12-14 Sat> Text-based editor version 2.1.1
