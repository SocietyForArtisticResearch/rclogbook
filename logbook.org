*** Undo button
*** Markdown in text/html tools
*** Text tools size warnings, current lack of limits stimulates risky designs.
*** Keywords: 
- Make keywords mandatory on publication
- Have a combination of closed and open vocabularies
*** Make exposition version on submit 
(also visible for admins) for later reference/compare changes
*** exposition metadata export for journals
*** journal submission as application
*** application programs
save vs. submit, inform/warn people when deadline is close, message on save that this is not submitting
*** searchable inbox
*** object preview images without fixed width/height ratio. 
- also objects even without image, "tumblr" page
- state share status clearly
- display abstract on/off setting
- show keywords
- tagging for profile organization / change group button for item
- collapse all groups
*** dates of expositions: 
- remove free "date" field. 
- add automatic creation date
- publication date will not be altered by unpublish/republished (only last modified)
*** editor view
- how to avoid them being portal admins
- list of objects of which they are editors
*** graphical editor
- pixel by pixel movement of tools with arrow keys (and pixel number display)
- linking to a tool instead of a position
- refresh overview when a tool was deleted
*** Archiving function
*** Sortable list view of expositions on "Recent activity" "Recent publications", "My Profile" and other locations in RC.
** Problems
*** Unpublishing changes publication date when republished (for example 
*** Collaboration tab needs explanation text about what is what.         :UI:
*** Supervisor permissions behave weird on publication etc.
*** Objects outside of visual field.
*** No quick way for supervisor to delete/manage all their notes.
*** Notes list
*** Private note
*** No duplicate names for expositions
*** Common user confusions:
- Adding a page, not showing up in Table of Contents
- Work / Exposition
- Video tool / Video embed
- PDF tool : Preview / PDF fields mixup
- Audio tool should not be an empty box, but communicate:
  "Audio tool: filename"
*** DONE Preview of text-based exposition does not update quickly enough
*** background color of text-based editor should not change when body background-color is set (connected to margin issue)
*** If a footnote reference is copied from one page to the next, the content of the footnote remains in the old page.

* Bugs
** Bugs to be reported
*** scrollbars hidden on Mac OS 
*** HTML tool show's page's background color (good), but even as the tool itself has another background color (bad).

** Reported Bugs
*** Full screen doesn't work with autoplay
*** Published exposition cannot be connected to
*** Issue name is missing from research page. (also ordering is arbitrary, should either be customizable or make sense) (reporter: NMH)
*** date of last change not updated for text-based expositions 
*** position of tools can be made negative by mouse, but not edited by number in the style tab. (reporter: JAR)


** Fixed Bugs
*** DONE exporting JAR expositions caused problems with Safari/Chrome (Aubiome project)
