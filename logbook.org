* RC Logbook

This file contains information on the current state of RC developments
and lists ideas, features, bugs and problems.

* Features and ideas
** Features in development


*** Archive expositions [ requested ]
*** Media usage
**** How much media do users have?
**** Is it used in any exposition or made public?

**** Ordering of portals by creation data / or alphabetic
*** Research Video Integration
** Features to be requested
*** TODO fix "add all" button in collaboration message dialog
*** TODO fix default license in media repo
*** TODO fix default license in text editor (or maybe postpone?)
*** TODO Media of sets cannot be selected within tools, this is a problem for slideshow tool.
*** TODO Picture tool should use tool defaut instead of intrensic size 
*** TODO Implement fix for font-boosting both in text-based and graphical expositions
  #container-weave .tool-text {
    -webkit-text-size-adjust: none;
    -moz-text-size-adjust: none;
    -ms-text-size-adjust: none;
 }

   #container-weave .tool-simpletext {
      -webkit-text-size-adjust: none;
      -moz-text-size-adjust: none;
      -ms-text-size-adjust: none;
   }
*** TODO dublicate accounts (automatic detection)
*** TODO collaboration, finding the right person if you only have an email.
*** TODO Media that is used in exposition currenty throws an error that includes "mail" support link, but it is an expected mistake by the user.
*** TODO Add "published by" to articles on the frontpage, published by JAR for example.
*** TODO Send email to NTNU admin when FEIDE student has logged in first time, creating a new account
*** TODO Media url's in text-based editor, not always translated to live url (https://www.researchcatalogue.net/text-editor/simple-media-resource?research=547070&simple-media=945677)
*** TODO Snapshot stored when admin changes revision state from "in revision" -> "in review"
*** TODO add trashcan button for comments on pages that can be seen by the commenter.

** Released features
*** Media Repository & API
*** add support for .art domains
*** Frontpage Redesign
*** SARA feed on front page
*** File size limit HTML import (raise to 10gb)
*** cms for about, terms and other static pages
*** feide login for ntnu bergen, nmh
*** terms of use simplification, checkbox online
*** css of profile page responsiveness
*** Make exposition version on submit 
*** Objects can now have a negative position but still be edited.
** Ideas
*** Search box in navigation bar, so you can search in a single exposition. Future: expositions as searchable databases.
*** Managed expositions, how to make it easier within education to track an exposition and prevent students from making new ones?
*** Different versions of an exposition, that are somehow linked (show that something is just a newer version of an older exposition)
*** Internal statistics: Portal admins can view how many "expositions in progress" there are, see who is editing something.
*** How to stimulate early sharing in general?
*** Ac
*** Reviewing menu
**** Order of items (add note should be first option)
**** Add-note keyboard shortcut
**** remove all notes action
**** make impossible notes, impossible (near navigation bar) when clicked, it should come to front?
*** Even stronger warning on self-publication. Inform user on DOI being created, and that this means that the reference is permanent.
*** Users to be member of only a portal and not of RC, so they cannot accidentily publish in RC portal.
*** view media set in exposition, also as replacement for slide show tool
*** dropbox mode (upload/add but not change) in media repo
*** Increase audio quality of zencoder (currently, uses pretty low bitrate, filters out everything above 15k)
*** Search through expositions
*** Undo button
*** Markdown in text/html tools
*** Text tools size warnings, current lack of limits stimulates risky designs.
*** Keywords: 
- Make keywords mandatory on publication
- Have a combination of closed and open vocabularies
*** versions visible for admins - for later reference/compare changes
*** exposition metadata export for journals
*** journal submission as application
*** application programs
save vs. submit, inform/warn people when deadline is close, message on save that this is not submitting
*** searchable inbox
*** object preview images without fixed width/height ratio. 
*** profile page
- better display of objects without image, "tumblr" page
- state share status clearly
- display abstract on/off setting
- show keywords
- tagging for profile organization / change group button for item
- collapse all groups
*** dates of expositions: 
- remove free "date" field. 
- add automatic creation date
- publication date will not be altered by unpublish/republished (only last modified)
*** editor role 
- can we allow this role without needing them to be portal admins
- list of objects of which they are editors
*** graphical editor
- pixel by pixel movement of tools with arrow keys (and pixel number display)
- linking to a tool instead of a position
- refresh overview when a tool was deleted
- alignment
- adjustments of margins for position links on the right side of the weave-some links currently 'bump' into borders, displaying the wrong position
- group selection (lasso / box selection)
- group locking (moving constallation)
- prototype tool/template
- copy-paste style tab settings
*** Archiving function
- this is an alternative form of publication where it is fixed, but only visible to portal admins. 
- probably needs some extra meta-data like department / context in which the archived exposition was produced.
*** Sortable list view of expositions on "Recent activity" "Recent publications", "My Profile" and other locations in RC.
*** elm text editor based on https://github.com/SidneyNemzer/elm-text-editor
*** comments/notes
**** footnote like comments {^1}
**** inline comments {<<>>}
**** {media} tag should be embedded in newlines for proper parsing of markdown paragraphs 
**** we need to rendered html version, one for public preview not displaying comments and one for editing (with comments)
*** footnotes
**** singled shared model for both editors
**** one list for the entire exposition
**** type of footnotes (references etc)
**** footnote edit page
**** reference counting, footnotes need to know where they are used
** Problems
*** clicking tool should no open defaults 
*** empty tools when canceling tool dialogue
*** Black bars in JWPlayer, which dynamically aplies "object-fit:contain" causing lots o problems. .jwplayer.jw-stretch-uniform video { object-fit: cover !important; } is a solution for now.XS
*** Line-height in HTML tool can cause issues (there is a tinymce css line that inherits it from parent, but this causes wrong size if there is styling inline the copied html). One solution could be to filter pasted html.
*** Unpublishing changes publication date when republished (for example 
*** Collaboration tab needs explanation text about what is what.         :UI:
*** Supervisor permissions behave weird on publication etc.
*** No quick way for supervisor to delete/manage all their notes.
*** Notes list
*** Private note
*** No duplicate names for expositions
*** Common user confusions:
- Adding a page, not showing up in Table of Contents
- Work / Exposition
- Video tool / Video embed
- PDF tool : Preview / PDF fields mixup
- Audio tool should not be an empty box, but communicate:
  "Audio tool: filename"
*** DONE Preview of text-based exposition does not update quickly enough
*** background color of text-based editor should not change when body background-color is set (connected to margin issue)
*** If a footnote reference is copied from one page to the next, the content of the footnote remains in the old page.
*** dragging from media list creates tool with media size (not tool defaults)
* Bugs
** Bugs to be reported
*** If an exposition is unpublished and then republished, it cannot be reviewed (reviewer sees an error when they try to view it)
*** Reviewers added by the reviewer button in Users will not always be added (if they are existing users)
*** Supervised expositions show up in two places: Research Exposition (collaborated) and Research Expositions.
*** Background on WORK page is styled incorrectly: https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-work?work=410001
*** Video playback in HTML expositions breaks down on mobile.
**** Controls do not work on mobile 
**** In Safari this may be caused by a bug in Safari itself: https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/safari-csp-media-controls.html
*** Word import in Graphical Editor doesn't use HTML default tool settings
*** Scrollbars hidden on Mac OS 
*** [NO BUG] change of font in CSS is not accepted after the publication of the exposition:  https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/861875/861876
*** [CANNOT REPRODUCE] with pseudonyms the link to author's profile does not work
*** When user hits a "auth required" they do not return to the same page
*** [CASPER] The SARA unsubscribe menu accessed from the link of the announcement does not work
*** Problems with svg files in image tool, they are not properly scaled in edit -> options -> position -> size

** FONT FEATURE

We would like to reduce the "font warning" messages, by making sure
only fonts are used that RC can host itself. Currently, many of our
fonts (Verdana, Terminal), are not available everywhere, and we cannot
host them either as far as I understand?  This is what Microsoft say
about it:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/fonts/font-faq#redistribution-and-extended-rights
Correct font is kind of important, and authors are often not aware that the
wrong font may be displayed for many of their readers.

The solution we have in mind consists of 3 parts:

1. Add self-hosted fonts:

We have selected a list of public domain fonts, which the RC can
self-host, some of them are metrically based on Arial/Helvetica.
These fonts should be added to the HTML/text font dropdown and the
.woff served with every exposition:

Sans Serif:
    - Nimbus Sans L (https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/nimbus-sans-l)
    - Arimo (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arimo)
    - Lato (GF) (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato)
    - Roboto (GF) (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
    - PT Sans
      (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans?query=pt+sans)
    - Open Sans
      (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans)

Serif:
    - Libre Baskerville
      (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville?query=Libre+basker)
    - Merriweather (GF)
      (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?query=Merriweather)

Mono:
    - Roboto Mono (GF)
      https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono?query=roboto+mono
    - Courier Prime
      https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/courier-prime?q%5Bterm%5D=courier&q%5Bsearch_check%5D=Y
 


2. User added fonts:
In the expositions settings (edit metadata, edit research dialog) we
would like to add a "Fonts" tab, where the user can can upload
(multiple) fonts (.woff or .ttf). There should also be a required name
field, under which they will appear in the font dropdown of HTML and
text tools.  These fonts are local to the exposition and served by RC
when the exposition is viewed. We should add a warning that the user
is responsible for checking that the license of the font allows using
it.

3.
For new expositions, only make available the self-hosted and the
user-uploaded fonts. For all older expositions, authors should still
be able to use the old fonts (so both the old and new fonts). This
includes expositions that have been restored from an old snapshot.

Does this solution make sense to you as well, is it possible?




* Unification
** Media repo integration into graphical editor
*** Media Tab > Better fix icons for media upload and repo adding
*** Media Tab > Filters for Tags / Keywords / Type
*** Media Repo View > Mode where media repo replaces the weave editor, so user can create sets manage tags etc..
*** Technical > How could state be synced between media lists and repo's ? For example, when user is opening multiple tabs.
*** Real-time exposition editing (is this possible??)

** Graphical editor fixes
*** Scrollbars on text tools. User controls width, height is left to content.
*** Layers: editing part of an exposition where all other things are "locked". Currently tools can be locked
*** Form / block editor / media list would still be visible. drag and drop.
*** Table of contents / PAGES
