* RC Logbook

This file contains information on the current state of RC developments
and lists ideas, features, bugs and problems.

* Features and ideas
** Features in development
*** Media Repository API
*** Frontpage Redesign
*** SARA feed on front page
**** Ordering of portals by creation data / or alphabetic
*** Research Video Integration
** Features to be requested
** Released features
*** File size limit HTML import (raise to 10gb)
*** cms for about, terms and other static pages
*** feide login for ntnu bergen, nmh
*** terms of use simplification, checkbox online
*** css of profile page responsiveness
*** Make exposition version on submit 
*** Objects can now have a negative position but still be edited.
** Ideas
*** Increase audio quality of zencoder (currently, uses pretty low bitrate, filters out everything above 15k)
*** Search through expositions
*** Undo button
*** Markdown in text/html tools
*** Text tools size warnings, current lack of limits stimulates risky designs.
*** Keywords: 
- Make keywords mandatory on publication
- Have a combination of closed and open vocabularies
*** versions visible for admins - for later reference/compare changes
*** exposition metadata export for journals
*** journal submission as application
*** application programs
save vs. submit, inform/warn people when deadline is close, message on save that this is not submitting
*** searchable inbox
*** object preview images without fixed width/height ratio. 
*** profile page
- better display of objects without image, "tumblr" page
- state share status clearly
- display abstract on/off setting
- show keywords
- tagging for profile organization / change group button for item
- collapse all groups
*** dates of expositions: 
- remove free "date" field. 
- add automatic creation date
- publication date will not be altered by unpublish/republished (only last modified)
*** editor role 
- can we allow this role without needing them to be portal admins
- list of objects of which they are editors
*** graphical editor
- pixel by pixel movement of tools with arrow keys (and pixel number display)
- linking to a tool instead of a position
- refresh overview when a tool was deleted
- alignment
- adjustments of margins for position links on the right side of the weave-some links currently 'bump' into borders, displaying the wrong position
- group selection (lasso / box selection)
- group locking (moving constallation)
- prototype tool/template
- copy-paste style tab settings
*** Archiving function
- this is an alternative form of publication where it is fixed, but only visible to portal admins. 
- probably needs some extra meta-data like department / context in which the archived exposition was produced.
*** Sortable list view of expositions on "Recent activity" "Recent publications", "My Profile" and other locations in RC.
*** elm text editor based on https://github.com/SidneyNemzer/elm-text-editor
*** comments/notes
**** footnote like comments {^1}
**** inline comments {<<>>}
**** we need to rendered html version, one for public preview not displaying comments and one for editing (with comments)
*** footnotes
**** singled shared model for both editors
**** one list for the entire exposition
**** type of footnotes (references etc)
**** footnote edit page
**** reference counting, footnotes need to know where they are used
** Problems
*** Line-height in HTML tool can cause issues (there is a tinymce css line that inherits it from parent, but this causes wrong size if there is styling inline the copied html). One solution could be to filter pasted html.
*** Unpublishing changes publication date when republished (for example 
*** Collaboration tab needs explanation text about what is what.         :UI:
*** Supervisor permissions behave weird on publication etc.
*** No quick way for supervisor to delete/manage all their notes.
*** Notes list
*** Private note
*** No duplicate names for expositions
*** Common user confusions:
- Adding a page, not showing up in Table of Contents
- Work / Exposition
- Video tool / Video embed
- PDF tool : Preview / PDF fields mixup
- Audio tool should not be an empty box, but communicate:
  "Audio tool: filename"
*** DONE Preview of text-based exposition does not update quickly enough
*** background color of text-based editor should not change when body background-color is set (connected to margin issue)
*** If a footnote reference is copied from one page to the next, the content of the footnote remains in the old page.

* Bugs
** Bugs to be reported
*** Video playback in HTML expositions breaks down on mobile.
**** Controls do not work on mobile 
**** In Safari this may be caused by a bug in Safari itself: https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/safari-csp-media-controls.html
*** Word import in Graphical Editor doesn't use HTML default tool settings
*** Scrollbars hidden on Mac OS 
*** HTML tool show's page's background color (good), but even as the tool itself has another background color (bad).
*** change of font in CSS is not accepted after the publication of the exposition:  https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/861875/861876

** Reported Bugs
*** Full screen doesn't work with autoplay
*** metro js not loaded / Icons are not displayed

*** DONE position of tools can be made negative by mouse, but not edited by number in the style tab. (reporter: JAR, closed but not live)
*** DONE Fullscreen and Downloads on HTML-import videos (NTNU)
*** DONE (could not reproduce) Restoring an exposition while it was "in review", the "in review" status is inherited (SAR-1261)
