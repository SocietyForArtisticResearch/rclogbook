* RC Logbook

This file contains information on the current state of RC developments
and lists ideas, features, bugs and problems.



* In development
** Graphical editor: undo button and better versioning of exposition content :requested:
** Merging of text-based and graphical editors                  :in_progress:
    - allows authors to define both a graphical 2d layout and a responsive version of the same page content
    - the responsive version of an exposition is the same as text based, now understood as a linear ordering of tools
    - mixing the two formats within one exposition
    - fascilitate migrate pages between the two formats
    - the author decides which layouts are available to the reader
** Google fonts (safe fonts)                                     :in_progess:
** Archive expositions                                            :requested:
** Media usage                                                      :on_hold:
**** How much media do users have?
**** Is it used in any exposition or made public?
*** full text search :luc:



* Ideas
*** front page: add description of institutional portals
** Search :roadmap: 
*** navigation bar redesign, convert to responsive, better display of all authors

*** keyword search and list
*** keyword pages, follow and show authors that use the keywords.
*** feeds that are integrated with front page + infinite scroll + organised favourates, personal notes with it
*** sortable search results
*** searchable inbox
*** adding time/date filter in advanced search. :casper:
*** search box in navigation bar, so you can search in a single exposition. Future: expositions as searchable databases.
*** make keywords mandatory on publication
*** License as machine readable data embedded ?
** Profile page                                                     :roadmap:
*** better display of objects without image, "tumblr" page, sets should showcase media in attractive way.
*** share status clearly (no gray color)
*** display abstract on/off setting
*** show keywords on the object in the box
*** easier group management: tagging for profile organization / change group button for item
*** collapse all groups (how ?), expand all groups
*** change the group of items without drag and drop
*** list-like view.
*** cleanup of CV details edit profile
*** customizable display of external publications (easy way)
*** see list of collab/co-autherships of user (ex. academia.org)
*** see own followers
*** follow institutions
*** portal profile pages 
** managed expositions: 
how to make it easier within education to track an exposition and prevent students from making new ones?
** different versions of an exposition
that are somehow linked (show that something is just a newer version of an older exposition)
** accessibility
   alt-text for all visual tools
** internal portal stats
Portal admins can view how many "expositions in progress" there are, see who is editing something.
** reviewing menu :tero:
*** Order of items (add note should be first option)
*** Add-note keyboard shortcut (ctrl+shift+n)
*** Remove all notes action (of course confirm with user that they are sure).
*** make impossible notes, impossible (near navigation bar) when clicked, it should come to front? :tero:
** UX deleting media in editor 
   instead of forbidding deletion of media used as preview/background, ask the user for permission to delete it and automatically deselect/delink.
   If no background image is selected, it should either display the generated thumb or the background color in style.
** stronger warning on self-publication. :casper:
   Inform user on DOI being created, and that this means that the reference is permanent.
** users to be member of only a portal and not of RC, so they cannot accidentily publish in RC portal.
** view media set in exposition, also as replacement for slide show tool
** media repo dropbox mode 
   (upload/add but not change) in media repo
** audio quality of zencoder in videos 
   (currently, uses pretty low bitrate, filters out everything above 15k)
** markdown in text/html tools
** Exposition Validation (through api) 
*** external links (youtube, vimeo), should trigger warning.
*** text tools size warning, current lack of limits stimulates risky designs
** exposition metadata export for journals (editor/KC API)
** journal submission as application
** application programs
save vs. submit, inform/warn people when deadline is close, message on save that this is not submitting
** fix multilingual abstracts :tero:
   1. Authors should be able to select a main language for their abstract and title.
   2. The main language of an exposition should be displayed in the metadata page.
   3. The abstract displayed in the Navigation bar abstract box should be the same as the language of the exposition, and there should be a dropdown to switch between languages (if translations are available).
** downloading big exports  
   more fail safe: big expositions cause timeouts, like https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/568007/568008
** problematic resolution
   zencoder: When uploading a video format that is not supported, show user hint what would work.
** user grouping tags
   for users within portal user list (for organising)
** publication tags for expositions
   To have a better way to display educational outcomes, ongoing groupings of research.
   to separate it from keywords, archive organisation, similar to current reviewing tags.
** merge keywords
   of expositions and media repo
** media repo github repository public 
   (clean up old state first)
** duplicate page 
   command within editors (instead of copy paste tools)
** work migration 
   to media repo set
** fix "add all" 
   button in collaboration message dialog
** collaboration invite as live state 
   removed from messages, should be prompt or notification. State should be live from the current state
** picture tool  
** duplicate accounts 
   (automatic detection)
** Collaboration search
   finding the right person if you only have an email.
** Frontpage "published by" 
   to articles on the frontpage, published by JAR for example.
** send email to NTNU admin 
   when FEIDE student has logged in first time, creating a new account
** media url's 
   Reproduce? in text-based editor, not always translated to live url (https://www.researchcatalogue.net/text-editor/simple-media-resource?research=547070&simple-media=945677)
** snapshot stored when admin changes revision state
   from "in revision" -> "in review" (currenlty only happens when the author does it) 
** comments trashcan 
   for comments on pages that can be seen by the commenter.
** dates of expositions: 
*** remove free "date" field. 
*** remove add automatic creation date
*** remove publication date will not be altered by unpublish/republished (only last modified)
** editor role 
*** can we allow this role without needing them to be portal admins
*** list of objects of which they are editors
*** Adding editor to exposition creates an accept/decline invite which is unnecessary 20.10.2021th
*** Editors should see their expositions in portal review page? Alternatively some actions should be doable on My Profile page where the expositions are visible 20.10.2021th
** graphical editor
*** footnote should always show it's borders or the grid
*** pixel by pixel 
    movement of tools with arrow keys (and pixel number display)
*** refresh overview when a tool was deleted
*** alignment fix
    currently still a bit weird
*** adjustments of margins for position links on the right side of the weave-some links currently 'bump' into borders, displaying the wrong position
*** position link
add a button that directly copies current position to clipboard, 
in hyperlink menu, allow selecting a page/tool within the existing structure
*** group selection (lasso / box selection)
*** group locking (moving constallation)
*** prototype tool/template
*** copy-paste style tab settings
*** Sortable list view of expositions on "Recent activity" "Recent publications", "My Profile" and other locations in RC.

**** Ordering of portals by creation data / or alphabetic
**** Accessible color schemes. https://toolness.github.io/accessible-color-matrix/

** elm text editor features:
*** elm text editor based on https://github.com/SidneyNemzer/elm-text-editor - https://jxxcarlson.github.io/app/text-editor/index.html
*** comments/notes
*** footnote like comments {^1}
*** inline comments {<<>>}
*** {media} tag should be embedded in newlines for proper parsing of markdown paragraphs 
*** we need two rendered html versions, one for public preview not displaying comments and one for editing (with comments)
** footnotes
*** singled shared model for both editors
*** "portable footnotes" : footnotes as exposition "snippets" that can be organised in the Repo and used between different expositions and weaves.
*** one list for the entire exposition
*** type of footnotes (references etc)
*** footnote edit page
*** have a user default styling for footnotes (for example shadow is now default but this cannot be changed).
*** reference counting, footnotes need to know where they are used

* Problems

** Tools
- Clicking tool should not open defaults (How to open them? Menu options?)
- Empty tools when canceling tool dialogue
- Audio tool should not be an empty box, but communicate: "Audio tool: filename"
- PDF tool : Preview / PDF fields are confusing users
- Video tool / Video embed user awareness
** Autoplay in slideshow triggers "autoplay" message each slide, even if autoplay is allowed:
   https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/41240/41241
** Reviewers added by the reviewer button in Users will not always be added (if they are existing users)
** Adding a page, not showing up in Table of Contents, RC should ask when create page.
** copy media from one expo to another causes clones/mess
** What is maximum number of tools that can be copy-pasted
** CSS: table border-collapse is default in editor, but not in rendered exposition.
** Black bars in JWPlayer, which dynamically aplies "object-fit:contain" causing lots o problems. .jwplayer.jw-stretch-uniform video { object-fit: cover !important; } is a solution for now.
** Line-height in HTML tool can cause issues (there is a tinymce css line that inherits it from parent, but this causes wrong size if there is styling inline the copied html). One solution could be to filter pasted html.
** Unpublishing changes publication date when republished (for example) superadmins should be able to change it.a 
** Collaboration tab needs explanation text about what is what.          :UI:
** Supervisor permissions behave weird on publication etc. How 
** Notes
- No quick way for supervisor to delete/manage all their notes. 
- Notes list
- Private note
** No duplicate names for expositions
** background color of text-based editor should not change when body background-color is set (connected to margin issue)
** Footnotes
- If a footnote reference is copied from one page to the next, the content of the footnote remains in the old page.
- Footnotes can be copied from other expositions, which will result in dead links if the original exposition is made private
- If footnote is copied from exposition to another, it can cause permission problems (dead x's). We forbid it or support it.
- ?? Footnote issue -> if a label with text across two lines/paragraphs, creating a footnote with all highlighted seems to create two footnotes with different ID. I didn’t test this further, but seems odd.
** If an exposition is unpublished and then republished, it cannot be reviewed (reviewer sees an error when they try to view it)
** Supervised expositions show up in two places: Research Exposition (collaborated) and Research Expositions.
** Video playback in HTML expositions breaks down on mobile.
**** Controls do not work on mobile 
**** In Safari this may be caused by a bug in Safari itself: https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/safari-csp-media-controls.html
** Word import in Graphical Editor doesn't use HTML default tool settings
** change of font in CSS is not accepted after the publication of the exposition:  https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/861875/861876
** file type detection should not be done by file ending (can create unusable media)
** Menu of expositions in profile and of tools in workspace does not work in Windows 10, version 19041 
** Import as pdf should not be allowed
** Should videos be exported as well when export as epub in the text editor? Now they are not exported
** Graphical/Block editor sidebar collapse status should be stored (Refresh always brings it back) 8.11.2021th


* Reported Problems

** possible weirdness with sidebar, maybe to do with zoom: the bin did not appear (on two separate browsers/computers)
*** tero: once the 'pages' button did not appear for me

* Releases

** DONE When user hits a "auth required" they do not return to the same page
** DONE Front page, abstracts should be cropped to ellipses.

** DONE HTML tool show's page's background color (good), but even as the tool itself has another background color (bad).


** DONE Profile > Exposition groups are not saved between sessions for normal users
** DONE Export as pdf does not work in the text editor
** DONE WILLNOTFIX more users with Windows 10 cannot open the menu of expositions or profiles. (This is a sideeffect of weird virus js inject behaviour kasperski, users should want to turn it off, since it is pretty nasty). <https://superuser.com/questions/981959/how-to-disable-kaspersky-antivirus-javascript-injection>
** DONE public sets are visible also to users that are not logged in.
** DONE Fixed problem play tool state not being correct if another video stops the play tool.
** DONE Fixed problem with videos in footnotes that continued played when closed
** DONE fixed problem in graphical expos' where font sizes where blown up on mobile, causing layout problems
** DONE A published exposition in JAR does not appear in the public profile of one of the co-author
exposition: https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/462390/462391
author: Mariella Greil-Moebius https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/?person=91218
** DONE Fullscreen does not work in embedded videos. example 
https://www.researchcatalogue.net/editor?research=861875&weave=944937

** DONE Login-as does not work for feide accounts
** DONE position of tools can be made negative by mouse, but not edited by number in the style tab. (reporter: JAR, closed but not live)
** DONE Fullscreen and Downloads on HTML-import videos (NTNU)
** DONE (could not reproduce) Restoring an exposition while it was "in review", the "in review" status is inherited (SAR-1261)

** DONE Problems with svg files in image tool, they are not properly scaled in edit -> options -> position -> size
** [CASPER] The SARA unsubscribe menu accessed from the link of the announcement does not work
** DONE Preview of text-based exposition does not update quickly enough
** Archiving function
- this is an alternative form of publication where it is fixed, but only visible to portal admins.

** FONT FEATURE

We would like to reduce the "font warning" messages, by making sure
only fonts are used that RC can host itself. Currently, many of our
fonts (Verdana, Terminal), are not available everywhere, and we cannot
host them either as far as I understand?  This is what Microsoft say
about it:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/fonts/font-faq#redistribution-and-extended-rights
Correct font is kind of important, and authors are often not aware that the
wrong font may be displayed for many of their readers.

The solution we have in mind consists of 3 parts:

1. Add self-hosted fonts:

We have selected a list of public domain fonts, which the RC can
self-host, some of them are metrically based on Arial/Helvetica.
These fonts should be added to the HTML/text font dropdown and the
.woff served with every exposition:

Sans Serif:
    - Nimbus Sans L (https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/nimbus-sans-l)
    - Arimo (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arimo)
    - Lato (GF) (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato)
    - Roboto (GF) (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
    - PT Sans
      (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans?query=pt+sans)
    - Open Sans
      (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans)

Serif:
    - Libre Baskerville
      (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville?query=Libre+basker)
    - Merriweather (GF)
      (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?query=Merriweather)

Mono:
    - Roboto Mono (GF)
      https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono?query=roboto+mono
    - Courier Prime
      https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/courier-prime?q%5Bterm%5D=courier&q%5Bsearch_check%5D=Y
 


2. User added fonts:
In the expositions settings (edit metadata, edit research dialog) we
would like to add a "Fonts" tab, where the user can can upload
(multiple) fonts (.woff or .ttf). There should also be a required name
field, under which they will appear in the font dropdown of HTML and
text tools.  These fonts are local to the exposition and served by RC
when the exposition is viewed. We should add a warning that the user
is responsible for checking that the license of the font allows using
it.

3.
For new expositions, only make available the self-hosted and the
user-uploaded fonts. For all older expositions, authors should still
be able to use the old fonts (so both the old and new fonts). This
includes expositions that have been restored from an old snapshot.

Does this solution make sense to you as well, is it possible?
